                        <strong>Situation:</strong> Amazon needed to democratize ML education across 1M+ employees globally<br>
                        <strong>Task:</strong> Scale from conference room pilot to global infrastructure with measurable business impact<br>
                        <strong>Action:</strong> Built purpose-built classrooms, global LMS, standardized curriculum, and correlation tracking systems<br>

            <div class="question-block">
                <div class="question">"Your AWS EdStart experience generated $20M in revenue. How does that translate to managing OMG's partner ecosystem?"</div>
                <div class="your-answer">
                    <div class="answer-label">Your Response:</div>
                    "I understand both sides of the assessment business model - the platform provider and the implementer. At EdStart, I developed credit allocation frameworks, ROI tracking, and partner success metrics. For OMG, this means I can optimize both the assessment effectiveness AND the reseller experience to drive mutual success."

                    <strong>Likely Follow-up:</strong> "How would you handle a situation where a partner's feedback conflicts with your data?"<br>
                    <strong>Your Angle:</strong> "I'd use the IDS process - Identify the root cause, Discuss with data transparency, and Solve by testing hypotheses with both parties."

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Response:</div>
                    "Building for seniors taught me that AI effectiveness depends on accessibility and trust. For sales assessments, this means designing AI that feels helpful, not invasive - AI that explains its reasoning and builds confidence in both the assessor and the assessed. My 40% completion rate improvement came from understanding user barriers, not just technical capabilities."

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Response:</div>
                    "Accuracy without completion is worthless. My experience with senior-focused platforms showed me that user experience directly impacts data quality. A stressed or confused test-taker won't give authentic responses. I'd approach this by designing assessments that feel like helpful conversations rather than interrogations, while maintaining the rigor that makes OMG's correlations meaningful."

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Response:</div>
                    "I'd establish a continuous feedback loop with your partner network - they're on the front lines of sales evolution. At EdStart, I hosted regular community events that became innovation labs. For OMG, I'd create advisory councils of top-performing partners to identify emerging competencies, then validate them against your performance data before incorporating into assessments."

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Visionary Response:</div>
                    "Three key trends: <strong>1) Real-time coaching integration</strong> - assessments that provide immediate development paths, not just scores. <strong>2) Predictive scenario modeling</strong> - AI creating dynamic situations based on specific company contexts. <strong>3) Continuous assessment</strong> - moving from point-in-time snapshots to ongoing competency tracking. OMG is uniquely positioned to lead this evolution with your correlation data and partner network."

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Response:</div>
                    "I'd use three filters: <strong>1) Correlation impact</strong> - does it improve prediction accuracy? <strong>2) Partner value</strong> - does it help partners win more deals? <strong>3) Scalability</strong> - can it work across your 200+ industries? I'd focus on the intersection of these three, probably starting with AI-enhanced scenario generation since it leverages your data advantage while providing clear partner differentiation."

                    "Innovation should enhance, not replace, what's working. OMG's 21 sales competencies framework is validated - that's your foundation. Innovation comes in how we measure those competencies more effectively, not in changing what we measure. Think of it as upgrading the instrument while keeping the proven methodology."

                    <div class="answer-label">Your EOS-Aligned Approach:</div>

                        <strong>Situation:</strong> Founding Ask Goldie required understanding senior psychology and accessibility design - areas I had no experience in<br>
                        <strong>Task:</strong> Build an AI platform that seniors would actually use and trust<br>
                        <strong>Action:</strong> Spent months interviewing seniors, testing terrible early prototypes, failing at interface design, learning from each iteration<br>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> Achieved 40% higher completion rates than traditional platforms by embracing being bad initially and learning continuously

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Philosophy:</div>
                    "The best teaching comes from active learning. At Amazon, I scaled ML education not because I knew everything about ML, but because I understood learning systems. I taught by creating frameworks others could build on, while constantly learning from their applications. For OMG, I'd teach through documentation, process improvement, and knowledge sharing - while learning continuously from partners, users, and team members."

                <div class="your-answer">
                    <div class="answer-label">Your Example:</div>
                    "At AWS EdStart, I hypothesized that more credits would drive more partner engagement. The data showed the opposite - partners with unlimited credits were less engaged than those with constraints. This was inconvenient because it meant changing our entire incentive model, but we followed the data. The result was a more sustainable and effective partner program."

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Approach:</div>
                    "High performance is sustainable only when people can be human. I've found that flexibility in how/when work gets done often increases what gets accomplished. At my startups, I built around people's lives while maintaining clear accountability. The key is measuring outcomes, not activity, and giving people autonomy in how they achieve results."

                    "I built full-stack applications for both my recent startups, so I understand the implementation implications of design decisions.

                    "I'd bring both teams together with data: what's the business impact of each option? Marketing features drive acquisition, but backend improvements drive retention and accuracy.

                    <div class="answer-label">Your Collaborative Approach:</div>
                    "Their validation work is OMG's competitive advantage - I'd never override that lightly. Instead, I'd work with them to design experiments: can we A/B test new approaches while maintaining correlation standards? Can we enhance existing questions with AI without changing their core structure? The goal is evolution, not revolution."
